Neuro disabilities can range from paralysis or problems controlling movement (motor control), problems using or understanding language (aphasia), swallowing disorders (dysphagia), and problems with thinking and memory (cognition). Patients with such disabilities need a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to help them resume their functional and cognitive abilities. In India, there is a significant gap both for trained neuro physiotherapists and well-equipped rehabilitation centers. Atharv Ability aims to address this gap by providing rehabilitation programs for post-stroke patients, patients with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and pediatric neurological conditions as well as for other neurological conditions including Parkinsons, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis and pediatric neurological conditions. The center offers all these treatments under one roof, including neuro physiotherapy, advanced robotics therapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, cognitive therapy, aqua therapy, pain management, spine rehabilitation, activities of daily living training, and pediatric neurological rehabilitation. Since its launch, Atharv Ability has treated over 1,000 patients and conducted more than 3,000 multidisciplinary treatment sessions in just four months. Patients have experienced remarkable progress, with many who were previously wheelchair-bound regaining their independence. Post-stroke and post-TBI patients have successfully walked out of Atharv Ability with restored confidence and dignity. The pediatric section of the center provides specialized attention, empathy, care, and customized treatment programs for children with conditions like cerebral palsy and developmental delays. The vision of Atharv Ability is to provide accessible, affordable, and world-class rehabilitation treatment programs to every patient with a neurological disability, ensuring they regain their abilities and reintegrate into society.

            "Lupin Limited is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in India, with a strong presence in the domestic and global markets. The company has achieved significant success in the Indian market over the years, with its innovative products and strategic partnerships. In this report, we will explore the key factors that have contributed to Lupin's growth in the Indian market for the year 2024-25.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Innovative Product Portfolio:\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the key factors driving Lupin's growth in the Indian market is its innovative product portfolio. The company has developed a range of products across various therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory disorders, and oncology. These products are not only affordable but also effective, making them popular among patients and healthcare professionals.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, Lupin launched its generic version of Valsartan in 2024, which is used for treating hypertension and heart failure. This product was well-received by doctors and patients, contributing significantly to the company's revenue growth in the Indian market.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Strategic Partnerships:\n",
            "\n",
            "Another factor that has helped Lupin succeed in the Indian market is its strategic partnerships with other companies. These partnerships have allowed the company to expand its reach and offer more products to consumers.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2024, Lupin entered into a collaboration agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. This agreement gave Lupin access to Merck's portfolio of oncology products, allowing it to enter the growing cancer care market in India. This partnership helped Lupin establish itself as a leader in the oncology segment, contributing to its overall growth in the Indian market.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Strong Distribution Network:\n",
            "\n",
            "Lupin's distribution network is another important factor in its success in the Indian market. The company has a robust distribution system that ensures its products reach patients and healthcare providers quickly and efficiently. This has helped Lupin maintain a competitive edge in the market, even during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2024, Lupin invested heavily in expanding its distribution network, particularly in rural areas where access to quality healthcare is often limited. This investment paid off, as the company reported double-digit growth in its sales in these regions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Commitment to Research and Development:\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, Lupin's commitment to research and development has been critical to its success in the Indian market. The company invests heavily in R&D, focusing on developing new drugs and improving existing ones.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2024, Lupin launched several new products based on its R&D efforts, including a generic version of Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation and allergies. This product was well-received by patients and healthcare professionals, further cementing Lupin's position as a leader in the Indian pharmaceutical market.\n"
