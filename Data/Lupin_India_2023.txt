Lupin Digital Health, Lyfe
Lupin Digital Health, established in 2021, plays a 
crucial role in Lupin’s venture into digital healthcare. 
Its primary focus is to provide a Digital Therapeutics 
(DTx) platform to doctors and patients across various 
therapies. To support its ambitions, Lupin Digital Health 
has established a Tech, Product & Data hub in Bengaluru 
and a 24x7 Nerve Centre in Mumbai, aimed at building 
and operating a world-class digital healthcare product. 
The team comprises talented individuals from leading 
organizations in the digital and healthcare domains. 
Currently, Lupin Digital Health operates in 14 cities in

attacks and improve the vitals and quality of life for 
cardiac patients. It provides an end-to-end solution 
for cardiac patients, encouraging adherence to 
protocols established by their treating cardiologists.

regimens. Additionally, 83.3% of patients maintained

Atharv Ability
Atharv Ability, Lupin’s Neurological Rehabilitation 
Center, was inaugurated on the International Day 
of Persons with Disability in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla 
Complex. It serves as a cutting-edge outpatient facility 
for adults and children, specializing in neurological 
rehabilitation. The center offers comprehensive 
rehabilitation programs based on best clinical practices 
and utilizes state-of-the-art equipment. A team of 
qualified neurorehabilitation experts deliver quality care, 
making Atharv Ability a unique and all-encompassing 
rehabilitation destination.
Neurological disorders account for the highest 
percentage of total Disability Adjusted Life Years 
DALY*(6.3%) as compared to other diseases like 
Respiratory, HIV and TB, globally. While In India it is 
10%, one Indian suffers a stroke every 40 seconds and 
60% of stroke cases in India lead to disability. Neuro 
disabilities can range from paralysis or problems 
controlling movement (motor control), problems using 
or understanding language (aphasia), swallowing 
disorders (dysphagia), and problems with thinking and 
memory (cognition). Patients with such disabilities need 
a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to help them 
resume their functional and cognitive abilities.
In India, there is a significant gap both for trained neuro 
physiotherapists and well-equipped rehabilitation 
centers. Atharv Ability aims to address this gap by 
providing rehabilitation programs for post-stroke 
patients, patients with traumatic brain injury, spinal 
cord injury, and pediatric neurological conditions as 
well as for other neurological conditions including 
Parkinson’s, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis and 
pediatric neurological conditions. The center offers 
all these treatments under one roof, including neuro 
physiotherapy, advanced robotics therapy, speech 
and language therapy, occupational therapy, cognitive 
therapy, aqua therapy, pain management, spine 
rehabilitation, activities of daily living training, and 
pediatric neurological rehabilitation. 
Since its launch, Atharv Ability has treated over 
1,000 patients and conducted more than 3,000 
multidisciplinary treatment sessions in just four months. 
Patients have experienced remarkable progress, with 
many who were previously wheelchair-bound regaining 
their independence. Post-stroke and post-TBI patients 
have successfully walked out of Atharv Ability with 
restored confidence and dignity. The pediatric section of 
the center provides specialized attention, empathy, care, 
and customized treatment programs for children with 
conditions like cerebral palsy and developmental delays.
The vision of Atharv Ability is to provide accessible, 
affordable, and world-class rehabilitation treatment 
programs to every patient with a neurological disability, 
ensuring they regain their abilities and reintegrate into 
society.
Outlook
Lupin’s India business has a very positive outlook and is 
well poised to achieve sustainable growth. The company 
is actively working on various initiatives to enhance its 
performance. These efforts include focusing on business 
imperatives, process improvement, and engaging with 
stakeholders such as doctors, patients, distribution 
channels, and consumers. 
By leveraging its brand-building capabilities, enhanced 
manpower and robust portfolio of products, and by 
targeting depth into specific therapeutic segments, the 
company is well-positioned to achieve new milestones 
and contribute to a brighter future.
