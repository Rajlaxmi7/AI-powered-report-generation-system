Through digital and technology-based patient support programs, Lupin continues to enhance customer 
engagement, create disease awareness, and drive therapy adherence. Some notable initiatives include:
Heart Rate – The Missing Link
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
India accounts for one-fifth of the total number of 
deaths resulting from stroke and ischemic heart 
disease. In most cases, consistently high heartbeat 
indicates a larger underlying health condition. For the 
purpose of bringing attention to this critical health 
parameter and ensuring that medical professionals 
are aware of its importance, we have published a 
book entitled ‘Heart Rate, a missing link?’ in which 114 
eminent cardiologists have contributed. In order to 
increase the awareness of this issue, we created a new 
Guinness World Record™ title by creating the “Largest 
book sentence” having 4,921 copies of the book to 
display the title ‘Heart Rate, Is it a Missing Link?’
Shakti
In India, coronary heart disease remains the leading 
cause of death for women, yet awareness of the 
disease remains abysmally low. Lupin launched the 
Shakti Campaign on Women’s Day in March 2022, in 
order to raise awareness about heart health among 
women and to encourage them to lead healthy lives. 
Joint Airways Initiative
Lupin’s Joint Airways Initiative (JAI) is India’s first 
digital educator that educates patients on proper 
inhalation techniques and offers a wide range of 
value-added services that enable them to breathe 
easier. 
Humrahi
Among the services offered by the Humrahi Patient 
Education Program are insulin pen education, insulin 
storage tips, diet counselling and exercise suggestions. 
Humrahi is currently covering 20 cities physically and 
pan India virtually, Humrahi has engaged more than 
4,000 HCPs and touch the lives of over 1,50,000 
patients through its services.
